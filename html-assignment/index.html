            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My names Anisia Laporte, born May 1<sup>st</sup>and grew up here in Ottawa Ontario. I love being creative and have always loved art from a young age. Growing up I used to always take every art class in highschool and that became my favourite subject. Throughout my last few years of highschool I found a new interest in technology, which I then went on to continue learning and building computers.</p>

            <p>I slowly started merging both my interest and starting learning about digital art and media design. I began my education at Algonquin by taking the Computer Engeneering - Computer Science program. Started learning beginer level Java code, linux, math etc. After taking that for a few months I realised how much I missed taking art. I decided to finish the semester and later on switch over to the Interactive Media Design program to learn about both the things I love, computers and art.</p>
